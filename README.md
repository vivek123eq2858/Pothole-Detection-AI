# 🚗 Smart Road Insight – Live Pothole Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** and **OpenCV** to detect potholes in real-time from road images and videos.  
It highlights damaged road patches and provides live insights that can be integrated with **Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, and other navigation platforms** to help drivers take safer routes.  

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Real-time pothole detection in video streams  
- ✅ Works on both images and videos  
- ✅ Generates bounding boxes around detected potholes  
- ✅ Potential for integration with maps for live road condition updates  

## 🚀 Demo
🔹 Example of pothole detection on video:

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- OpenCV  
- Google Colab (for training with GPU)  

## 📂 Dataset
- Custom dataset with pothole images and labels (YOLO format).  
- Training was done on Google Colab with GPU.  

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Smart-Road-Insight.git
   cd Smart-Road-Insight


   Install dependencies:

pip install ultralytics opencv-python


Run detection on images:

python detect_images.py


Run detection on video:

python detect_video.py

🌍 Vision

Imagine a navigation system that not only guides you to your destination but also shows live road health.
This project aims to reduce accidents, save vehicles from damage, and make travel safer.

🤝 Collaboration

I’m looking to collaborate with mapping companies, smart city initiatives, and investors to scale this solution and integrate it into real-world navigation systems.
