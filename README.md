# 🚗 Smart Road Insight – Live Pothole Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** and **OpenCV** to detect potholes in real-time from road images and videos.  
It highlights damaged road patches and provides live insights that can be integrated with **Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, and other navigation platforms** to help drivers take safer routes.  

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Real-time pothole detection in video streams  
- ✅ Works on both images and videos  
- ✅ Generates bounding boxes around detected potholes  
- ✅ Potential for integration with maps for live road condition updates  

## 🚀 Demo
🔹 Example of pothole detection on video:
